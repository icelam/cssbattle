# My submissions on CSSBattle

This repository archives all of my submissions on [CSSBattle](https://cssbattle.dev). CSSBattle is a CSS coding competition where participants are tasked with recreating target designs using HTML and CSS as short as possible.

## Objective

The main objective of this repository is to provide a centralized location to track and showcase my progress in the CSSBattle challenges. Each submission is organized by the challenge type and number, and the relevant HTML and CSS code, as well as an image of the target design, are included in a README file for each submission. By maintaining this repository, I aim to document my learning journey, demonstrate my CSS skills, and share my CSSBattle experience with others.

## Repository Structure
The repository is organized as follows:

```

├── Battles/
│   ├── 001/
│   │   ├── README.md
│   │   └── target@2x.png
│   └── 002/
